Note: “Will” represents before some specific phase and “Did” represents after the completion of that phase.

//Mounting : Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

1. constructor() and super():
The constructor method is called before the component is mounted to the DOM
This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.
The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and 
other initial values.
The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, 
this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component).


2. render(): This method actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

3. componentDidMount: This function is invoked right after the component is mounted on the DOM i.e. 
this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed for the first time

//Updating: A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
4. static getDerivedStateFromProps(): getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) is a static method that is called just before render() 
method in both mounting and updating phase in React. It takes updated props and the current state as arguments.

5. setState(): This function is used to update the state of a component.

6. shouldComponentUpdate(): This method is invoked before rendering an already mounted component when new props or states are being received.
This method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
If returned false then the subsequent steps of rendering will not be carried out. 

7. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is invoked just before the DOM is being rendered. 
It is used to store the previous values of the state after the DOM is updated.
Note: If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method,
otherwise you will get an error.

8. componentDidUpdate(): The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

//Unmounting: The final phase of unmounting the component from the DOM.
9. componentWillUnmount(): This function is invoked before the component is finally unmounted from the DOM i.e.
this function gets invoked once before the component is removed from the page and this denotes the end of the lifecycle.
